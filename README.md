About Plurr
===========

Handling plurals, genders and conditionals in strings is not a particularly
favorite task for programmers for many reasons. There's no common agreement
on how to handle such variants, so all existing approaches are either
platform-specific (like gettext/po), or have limitations (for example you
can't have multiple plurals in one string), or not particularly translator-
friendly, like Java's MessageFormat/ChoiceFormat.

**Plurr is a universal format specification for handling plurals, genders,
conditionals and placeholders** designed to be easy to support for
developers and understandable for translators yet robust to support different
language requirements. Plurr formatters are implemented in:
**Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, and Python**. Feel free to contribute
to this project and provide support for your favorite languages.

The plural forms we use can be found at the [Translate Project page](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/localization-guide/en/latest/l10n/pluralforms.html).

Advantages
----------

 1. You can use Plurr with any L10N library of your choice: you can store and
    read Plurr-formatted messages the same way as you do for any other strings.
 2. Same string format across multiple languages means that strings can be
    reused more effectively. This all reduces the time and cost of translation.
 3. Named placeholders provide a great context for translators, and this means
    better translation quality.
 4. Named placeholders allow to change their order in the final string if this
    is more appropriate for a particular target language.
 5. Less programmatic string concatenation also helps understand the message as
    a whole.

### Syntax Example

```elm
Do you want to delete {N_PLURAL:this {N} file|these {N} files} permanently?
```

Which, depending on the provided `N` value, will render as (for English):

  * N = 1, N_PLURAL = 0: `Do you want to delete this 1 file permanently?`
  * N = 5, N_PLURAL = 1: `Do you want to delete these 5 files permanently?`

The value of N_PLURAL is determined by calling a plural() function with the
value of N, and is language-dependent. By default, plurals are calculated
automatically: when `FOO_PLURAL` placeholder is found and its value is not
provided to the formatting function, Plurr will try to do
`FOO_PLURAL = plurals(FOO)` internally, taking into consideration the current
locale defined for the Plurr object. Below is a sample JavaScript code:

```javascript
var p = new Plurr();  // create a Plurr object (once). Default locale is English
...
alert(p.format(
  "Do you want to delete {N_PLURAL:this {N} file|these {N} files} permanently?",  // message
  {'N': 5}  // parameters
));
```

The syntax itself is not something new, it is similar to the one used in the
already mentioned Java's MessageFormat, but it is minimalistic and contains no
sensitive words that translators can inadvertently change (and break).

Format specification
--------------------

### 1. Simple named placeholders

#### Format

```elm
{NAME}
```

#### Example

```elm
{FOO} and {BAR}
```

Here `{FOO}` will be substituted with the provided FOO value, and `{BAR}` —
with the value of BAR.


Recommended is the use of capital `A..Z` and `_` symbol — this makes
placeholders stand out in the text, which gives some additional clue to
translators that these sequences are something special and should not be
translated.

There are no restrictions on placeholder names, except that they must not
contain `}` or `:` symbol.

When you need to represent symbols `{` or `}` themselves in the final string,
replace them with named placeholders with corresponding values, for example:

```javascript
alert(p.format(
  "I love {<}curly{>} braces.",
  {
    '<': '{',
    '>': '}'
  }
));
```

### 2. Placeholders with alternatives

```elm
{CHOICE:FORM0[|FORM1][|FORM2][|FORM3][|...]}
```

where:

  * `CHOICE` is a zero or a positive integer.
  * `FORM0`, `FORM1` and so on are the alternative versions of the string for
    each value of CHOICE (starting from 0).

If less forms are provided than the value of `CHOICE`, the last form is used.

As `|` is used to delimit different alternatives, in order to display such
symbol in the final string, replace it with named placeholder with the
corresponding value (same as for `{` and `}` in the section above).

#### Example in English:

```elm
{N_PLURAL:{N} file|{N} files}
```

will render as:

  * N = 0, N_PLURAL = 1: `0 files`
  * N = 1, N_PLURAL = 0: `1 file`
  * N = 2, N_PLURAL = 1: `2 files`
  * N = 5, N_PLURAL = 1: `5 files`

#### Example of the same string translated into Russian:

```elm
{N_PLURAL:{N} файл|{N} файла|{N} файлов}
```

will render as:

  * N = 0, N_PLURAL = 2: `0 файлов`
  * N = 1, N_PLURAL = 0: `1 файл`
  * N = 2, N_PLURAL = 1: `2 файла`
  * N = 5, N_PLURAL = 2: `5 файлов`

### 3. Multiple placeholders in the same string

Inside a string, there can be multiple placeholders of any kind.

#### Example:

```elm
{X_PLURAL:{X} file|{X} files} found in {Y_PLURAL:{Y} folder|{Y} folders}.
Do you want to {COMMAND:copy|move|delete} {X:them|it|them}?
```

Here, in addition to handling plurals, we use a value of `COMMAND` placeholder
to display different verbs.

#### Same example in Russian:

```elm
В {Y_PLURAL:{Y} папке|{Y} папках|{Y} папках} {X_PLURAL:найден {X} файл|найдены {X} файла|найдено {X} файлов}.
Хотите {X:его|их} {COMMAND:скопировать|переместить|удалить}?
```

### 4. Handling genders

Handling genders is the same as handling any other type of placeholders. You
just need to provide a parameter (let's name it `GENDER`), which evaluates to,
say, `0` for male, `1` for female, and `2` in case the gender is unknown (the
way you number genders is purely arbitrary, but we recommend sticking to some
scheme that you use consistently across your application). Then all you need to
do is to construct a message like this:

```elm
Do you want to leave {GENDER:him|her|them} a message?
{GENDER:He|She|They} will see it when {GENDER:he|she|they} {GENDER:logs|logs|log} in.
```

### 5. Nested placeholders and special cases

Sometimes one would like to say "One file" instead of "1 file", and "No files"
instead of "0 files". That's (and other scenarios) are possible with nested
placeholders:

```elm
{X:No files|One file|{X} {X_PLURAL:file|files}} found.
```

Here we first make a choice based on the value of `X`, where for values `0` and `1` we render
special messages, and for values `2` and above we render the nested plural-aware placeholder.

#### Same example in Russian:

```elm
{X:Не найдено файлов|Найден один файл|{X_PLURAL:Найден {X} файл|Найдено {X} файла|Найдено {X} файлов|}}.
```

Such an approach allows translators to provide most natural translation
possible, and gives some peace of mind to developers helping them reduce the
amount of supporting `if...else` code in their applications.
